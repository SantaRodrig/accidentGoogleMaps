# accidentGoogleMaps

This webapp uses Google Maps' visualization tools to display car accidents from June 2016 - June 2021. The data was is visualized through a heatmap layer like someon would see on Snapchat where the redder the blip/area the more sever the accident was. To view how the map changes, the user would use the sliders (year, month, day) and the text boxes (city and state) to see different part of the United States. Once there is a city and state value, the user can use the submit button or they can use the day slider to see the total month accidents (day zero) or a specific day. After a search, the webpage displays certain statistics such as the total number of accidents, the average accident severity, and six of the accidents' descriptions with their severity next to it.

This webapp is built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and JQuery.
